# **Project Brief: “Sleep, Scan, Repeat: The Ultimate Nap Quest”**

### **Project Overview**

Are you a nap enthusiast? A snooze connoisseur? Or just someone who’s mastered the art of sleeping in the weirdest corners of campus? Fear not, weary scholar—we’ve got you covered.

Our project is a **multimedia, Python-powered sleep rating system** designed to track, rate, and gamify sleeping habits across campus. It combines **personality quizzes**, **interactive QR codes**, **randomly cryptic quotes**, and **achievements for the elite nappers**. Basically, it’s like Pokémon, but instead of catching monsters, you catch Zs.

### **Why We’re Building This**

- **Purpose:** Art + design + chaos. We want to make sleep exploration a **fun, interactive experience** for stressed college students.
- **Measure of Success:**
    - Students actively scanning QR codes instead of just scrolling Instagram in bed.
    - Number of “sleep achievements” unlocked.
    - Amount of mysterious quotes that spark existential dread or laughter.
- **Goals to Achieve:**
    - Create a smooth, functional Python system for ratings and quizzes.
    - Make QR codes that are easy to scan and visually fun.
    - Incorporate multimedia elements: images, audio (snore sounds optional), video clips (like “sleepy campus vibes”), and narrative commentary.
- **Critical Parts:**
    1. Sleep rating system for different campus areas.
    2. QR codes strategically placed across campus for reviews.
    3. Achievements system for rare sleep styles or “all-area conquerors.”
    4. MBTI-style sleep quiz to classify your snooze personality.
    5. Randomly generated mysterious quotes that make you question life… or nap longer.

### **It’s Not Just About the Code**

We want to **push boundaries**:

- Experiment with interactive multimedia.
- Learn from bugs (yes, we know there will be crashes when too many students scan at once).
- Make something **both elegant and ridiculous**, meaningful yet functional—basically the perfect embodiment of college life.
